What the hell is that ?
=======================

This part of the documentation is meant for us (the 2016 prologin members) to take the lead in the developpement of sadm, as the contributors who did it at first are mostly unavailable.

At first, we would document sadm as it is now, and we would then try to make some improvements, as supporting ipv6.
